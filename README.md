📚 Do you self-study a lot using online resources?
If you're anything like me, you probably save them in a hundred different ways —
 🔖 Bookmarking websites,
 📂 Saving YouTube playlists,
 📩 Or even forwarding links to yourself on WhatsApp.
 
And then the chaos begins.
You vaguely remember a video or article, but...
Was it on YouTube? Did I send it to a friend? Was it bookmarked or buried in my messages?!!
Now you have to scroll endlessly through multiple platforms, fighting distractions and losing time — often ending up in a spiral of clickbait and doomscrolling.

That’s why I built Sapience 🧠
A minimal, personal productivity platform that helps you stay organized and focused:
✅ Resource Hub – Save all your study links (websites, playlists, videos) under titles you can easily search later. No more “where did I save that?”
✅ To-Do List – Keep track of your tasks with a clean, simple interface.
✅ Calendar – Save your schedules like upcoming exams, contests, deadlines, or classes.
✅ Pomodoro Timer – With customizable work/break sessions or the classic 25–5 timing (just hit reset).
